    Steps:
    1. Download playlist from Spotify
    2. Download/create playlist on Radioterio
    3. Filter only new tracks
    4. Initialize tracks processing.
    4. Until all tracks are in finished state:
    4.1. Update status of current downloads
    4.2. For each track do:
    4.2.1. If associated download contains the track:
    4.2.1.1. Upload track to Radioterio.
    4.2.1.2. Add uploaded track to the end of playlist.
    4.2.1.3. Mark the track processing as finished (||).
    4.2.2. If associated with the track downloads have been finished:
    4.2.2.1. Find another new candidate on a torrent tracker.
    4.2.2.2. Start the new download.
    4.2.2.3. Add the download to the track's candidates.
    5. Drop tracks processing state.
